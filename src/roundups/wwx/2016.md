# WWX2016 Highlights

This post is a brief post on what _I_ thought were the some of the highlights from this
years WWX2016, hosted at Mozilla Paris, _[like last year](https://haxe.io/roundups/wwx/2015/)_,
and again organized by [Silex Labs](https://twitter.com/silexlabs).

## Making the most of Haxe by [Juraj Kirchheim](https://twitter.com/back2dos)

I reckon that those of us who use Haxe primarily for back-end or front-end development
should be excited by Juraj's work on [`tink_http`](https://github.com/haxetink/tink_http/), [`tink_sql`](https://github.com/haxetink/tink_sql/) and [`tink_json`](https://github.com/haxetink/tink_json/), not only for potentially being great libraries, but for demonstrating clearly how to
use Haxe's type system to create type safe, fast libraries.

Checkout Juraj's talk for much more information.

## Kha Returns by [Robert Konrad](https://twitter.com/robdangerous)

Robert goes through how he has been focusing on making Kha fast. If your unfamiliar
with Kha, you need to understand that Kha _**was already fast**_. Robert has added
`kha.FastFloat` a special type that uses the _fastest_ `Float` depending on your compile target,
`kha.simd` package and increased loading times of your images.

Robert also talks about [Krafix](https://github.com/KTXSoftware/kfx), his cross compiling shader tool,
the new features that have been added and the attention it has received from the Unity team. 
`G5`, a new graphics API for Kha, which targets Metal, Direct3D12 and Vulkan, is an API based on Vulkan.

This is _only_ some of the impressive new features Robert has added to Kha, you'll have to watch his
talk to find out what Krom, how it interacts with Kode Studio and more.

## Unreal.hx - Using Haxe with the [Unreal Engine 4](https://www.unrealengine.com/what-is-unreal-engine-4) by [Cauê Waneck](https://twitter.com/cwaneck)

Cauê, the author of the C# and Java Haxe compiler targets, working for [Proletariat Inc](http://proletariat.com/),
has created [`unreal.hx`](https://github.com/proletariatgames/unreal.hx), the most feature rich language binding to Unreal Engine, 
compatible with Hugh Sanderson's [Cppia runtime](https://haxe.io/roundups/wwx/2015/#cppia) and DCE compatible. 
By using Cppia, you gain fast development iteration, so instead of taking minutes to compile, its sub seconds.

Watch Cauê's talk to find out more on how he is auto-generating the type definitions for Unreal
and a live demo.
